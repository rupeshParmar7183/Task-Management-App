# Task Management App

A Flutter project for managing tasks efficiently.

## Overview

The Task Management App is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks by allowing them to create, update, delete, and organize tasks. It comes with powerful features such as setting deadlines, reminders, and categorizing tasks by priority. Additionally, the app syncs tasks across devices to ensure you never miss a beat.

## Features

### Task Management:
- Create, edit, delete, and view tasks
- Mark tasks as "Completed" or "Pending"

### Task Organization:
- Set deadlines and reminders
- Categorize tasks by priority
- Search and filter tasks (optional bonus feature)

### Data Storage:
- SQLite: Store and persist task details
- Hive: Manage user preferences (app theme, default sort order, etc.)

### State Management:
- Uses Riverpod for robust and testable state management

### Architecture:
- Follows MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns:
    - **Model**: Defines data models for tasks and user preferences.
    - **ViewModel**: Handles business logic and state updates.
    - **View**: Implements a clean, responsive UI.

### Responsive Design:
- Optimized for both mobile and tablet devices
    - **Mobile**: Compact task list view
